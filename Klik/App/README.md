## INTRODUCTION ##

This is a simple game where all you can do is click to earn points. It will show you your high-score for points 
(as _H-Score_) and your highest cps/clicks-per-second score (as _H-CPS_). It also shows your current score (as _Score_) 
and your current cps (as _CPS_). You can reset your current score by clicking the `TAB` key, and you can reset your 
highest _CPS_ score by clicking the `BACKSPACE` key. The CPS is calculated by finding the time between the previous 
click and the current click, and then diving a second by that time, the counter may sometimes seem inaccurate, but this 
shouldn't have any effect on your highest cps score.

## CONTROLS ##

- `BACKSPACE`: Reset your highest clicks-per-second score (_H-CPS_) back to 0.
- `SHIFT`: Opens the help message in the program window.
- `TAB`: Resets your current points score (_Score_) back to 0.
- `ESCAPE`: Closes the program and saves your data.
- `LEFT MOUSE`: If you click the `Click Me!` button on the main screen you wil; get a point.
- `CONTROL`: Opens the *_README.md_* file (this file) in the default text editor on your machine.

## CHEATING ##

If you try and edit the score data in the *_Data_* folder then the program will catch you out for cheating, and the only
way for you to keep playing is to delete all of the files in the *_Data_* folder (erasing all of your scores).  
  
If you edit any of the files in the *_App_* folder the program will either break and be unplayable or you will be caught
out for cheating. If you are caught out for cheating the only way that you will be able to play again is if you undo the
edits you made to the file(s) or you reinstall the game.  
  
If you delete or move any of the files in the *_Lib_* folder the program will not work properly, either it will be 
missing sound or images, but won't change the actual functionality of the game.
